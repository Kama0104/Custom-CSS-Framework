Installation: By downloading the CSS Framework files through clone the project repository containing the CSS Framework.
Usage:In the HTML file, add a link to the CSS file using a <link> tag. Place this tag within the <head> section of the HTML file. The link should reference the path to the css-framework.css file. After that start using the CSS Framework styles and utility classes in the HTML.

Customization instructions:
a. Open the variables.scss file in a visual studio. This file contains variables that control various aspects of the CSS Framework.
b. Modify the values of the variables to customize the framework according to preferences.
c. Save the changes to the variables.scss file.
d. The Sass compiler /which you set up earlier/ will detect the changes in the variables file and automatically recompile the CSS. This means new customized styles will be applied to the website.
